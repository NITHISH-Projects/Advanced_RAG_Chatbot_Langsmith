The subscription method is defined in TS 29.520 section 5.1.6.2.2 and section 5.1.6.2.3.  Attributes that should be set are: supportedFeatures should include AbnormalBehaviour, the event should be set to ABNORMAL_BEHAVIOUR, exptAnaType should be set to COMMUN, and exptAnaType should be set to SUSPICION_OF_DDOS_ATTACK.  The target UEs can be identified by supis, intGroupIds or anyUe attribute in the tgtUe attribute.",

It will conditionally contain the qosFlowRetThd (QoS Flow Retainability Threshold), ranUeThrouThd (RAN UE Throughput Threshold), and snssai.  If it is a prediction, then it will contain the confidence level, which is 0 to 100.  Either qosFlowRetThd or ranUeThrouThd attribute shall be provided.",
    "The type Ncgi is defined in TS 29.571 in section 5.4.4.6 and represents the NR cell identity within an operatorâ€™s RAN.  It must contain the PlmnId, NrCellId, and the Nid may be present.  The NID is defined further in TS 23.003.",
